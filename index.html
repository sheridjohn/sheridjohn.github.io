      <h4>About Me</h4>

    <p>My name is John Sheridan, and I've created this website to try and practice
       and upskill on my front end web developer skillset. After getting my degree
       in computer applications from DCU, I had intended
      to start my career along the software development track. However, this didn't
      exactly work out as intended. After graduating
      from college I went to work for the company in which I had done my work placement with during
      college. My role there was a mix between development and support. I moved to
      a developer suppot role in a bigger company after 9 months in that company.
      The developer support role appealed
      to me as I believed it would be a good way to get to know the product through
      the support aspect of the job, and also hone my development skills there,
      with many development projects planned for the team to work on.
      Though I did get some dev projects to work on there, the companys leadership
      transitioned the team from development support to application support. This
      meant there was very little time to be given to dev projects, as these would
      be totally outside the expected day to day responsibilities of the role.
    </p>
    <p>From there, I stayed on the support track for my next few jobs, as I did enjoy,
and was good at, many aspects of the support role. However, each support role I
took on was initially eager for my programming background, with much talk of devlopment
projects and building support tooling during the interview process, but ultimately
the role never led to these projects, usually because the day to day responsibilities
of the support role didn't allow any extra time for these side projects.
This bothered me a little bit, because while I love the problem solving and troubleshooting
of support, I didn't get quite the same satisfaction from that as I did from writing code and seeing it run.
In late February 2020 I found the application <a href="https://getmimo.com">Mimo</a>
and started to go through the
web developer course. It really reminded me how much I love writing, running, and
debugging code. There's no satisfaction for me quite like working on code and
seeing it come to life. So, as I and my partner had some savings to cover my share
of the mortgage for a few months, I decided to resign from my support job and spend
some time going over the basics of front end web development, in order to get
an entry or junior level front end/web developer role.</p>

<p>It is a bit of a risk, but ultimately within support I was always wondering if
support was really the best track for me, or if I was missing out on a better/happier
fit with development. I didn't want to have any regrets or be left wondering
about a career in software development, so I've decided to take the leap and try my hand at it.</p>

      <h4>About this Site</h4>
      <p>I've built this site to show I have a grasp of the fundamentals of front end web
development: HTML, CSS, and Javascript. There's a page for my <a href="cv.html">C.V</a>,
a page for some <a href = "examples.html">javascript exercises and samples</a>, a page showing
I have the <a href = "reactPractice.html">fundamentals of React</a>,
 and this About page. As well as the page for javascript examples I've also
 coded a button which can be used to toggle the site between light and dark mode,
which you can click on the bottom of each page.</p>
