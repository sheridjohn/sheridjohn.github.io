      <h4>About Me</h4>

    <p>My name is John Sheridan, and I have created this website to practice
       and improve upon my web developer skillset. After obtaining my degree
       in computer applications from DCU, I had intended
      to start my career along the software development track. However, this did not
      exactly work out as intended. After graduating
      from college I went to work for the company in which I had completed a work placement with during
      college. My role there was a mix between development and support. I moved to
      a developer suppot role in a larger company after 9 months.
      The developer support role appealed
      to me as I believed it would be a good way to get to know the product through
      the support aspect of the job, and also hone my development skills there,
      with many development projects planned for the team to work on.
      Though I did work on some development projects, the company's leadership
      transitioned the team from development support to application support. Which,
      within that company, removed the opportnity to gain more experience in this regard.
    </p>
    <p>From there, I stayed on the support track for my next few roles, as I enjoyed
      many aspects of the support role, and had developed a strong skill set within this field.
       However, I found that potential employers were initially eager for my
       programming background, and offered me the opportunity to work on development
projects and building support tooling during the interview process, but ultimately
the role never led to these projects.
While I love the problem solving and troubleshooting
of support, I find that I do not get quite the same satisfaction from this alone, as I
do from working on code.
In late February 2020 I found the application <a href="https://getmimo.com">Mimo</a>
and started to go through the
web developer course. It reminded me how much I love writing, running, and
debugging code. There is no satisfaction for me quite like working on code and
seeing it come to life. I decided to resign from my support job and spend
some time improving the foundations of my web development knowledge, with the intention of
transferring to an entry or junior level web developer role.</p>

<p>It is a bit of a risk, but ultimately within support I was always wondering if
support was really the best track for me, or if I was missing out on a better/happier
fit with development. I do not want to have any regrets or be left wondering
about a career in software development, so I've decided to take the leap and try my hand at it.</p>

      <h4>About this Site</h4>
      <p>I've built this site to show I have a grasp of the fundamentals of front end web
development: HTML, CSS, and Javascript. There is a page for my <a href="cv.html">C.V</a>,
a page for some <a href = "examples.html">javascript exercises and samples</a>, a page where
the user can <a href = "contact.html">get in touch with me</a>, and this About page.
As well as the page for javascript examples I've also coded a button which can be
used to toggle the site between light and dark mode, which you can click on the
bottom of each page. I'm also curently building a page to show my understanding
and skills in <a href = "reactPractice.html">developing with React</a>, but this
 is a work in progress at the moment.
As the site progresses I'm hoping to also add in some back end functionality as well.</p>
