        <h3 class = "post-title">Becoming a web developer</h3>
        <div class="post-content">
          <p>After getting my degree in computer applications from DCU, I had intended to start my career along the development track.
            However, after graduating from college I went back to the company I had done my placement with during college.
          My role there was a mix between development and support. I moved to a developer suppot role in a bigger company
          after that. This role appealed to me as I believed it would be a good way to get to know the product through the
          support aspect of the job, and also hone my development skills there. Though I did get some dev projects to work on there,
        the companys leadership transitioned the team from development support to application support. Which meant there was very
        little time to be given to dev projects, as these would be totally outside the expected day to day responsibilities of the role. </p>

        <p>From there, I stayed on the support track for my next few jobs, as I did enjoy, and was good at, many aspects of the
          support role.
        However, I never really got the same satisfaction from that as I did from writing code and seeing it run. In late February
        2020 I found the
      application <a href="https://getmimo.com">Mimo</a> and started to go through the web developer course. It really reminded me how much I love writing, running,
      and debugging code.
     There's <strong><em>no</em></strong> satisfaction for me quite like working on code and seeing it come to life. So, as I and my partner had some savings to cover
     my share of the mortgage for a few months, I decided to resign from my support job and spend some time going over the basics
     of front end web development,
   in order to get an entry or junior level front end/web developer role.</p>
